# Logic-Design
This repository contains four laboratory assignments covering combinational circuits, sequential logic with Verilog, FPGA implementation, and memory systems.

## Labs Overview

1. **Lab 1: Combinational Circuit Design** (`lab1/`)
   - Simplify and implement a circuit with inputs A1, A0, B1, B0 and outputs X, Y, Z using only 74LS ICs in Logisim.  
   - Learn Boolean algebra simplification and basic gate usage. fileciteturn8file0

2. **Lab 2: Multiplexers, Decoders, and Logisim-Only Outputs** (`lab2/`)
   - Design an arithmetic–logic circuit with inputs A, B, S and outputs X (3-bit) and Y (8-bit decoded output) using multiplexers, decoders, and gates.  
   - Practice control logic and data path design. fileciteturn8file1

3. **Lab 3: Verilog Flip-Flop & Vending Machine Simulation** (`lab3/`)
   - Part 1: Implement and test an AC flip-flop and ic1406 module in Verilog with provided test benches.  
   - Part 2: Model a vending-machine–style seating system in Verilog including stateful seat tracking and warnings. fileciteturn8file2

4. **Lab 4: Bitwise Manipulation Memory & Enhanced Seating System** (`lab4/`)
   - Part 1: Build a combined ROM/RAM memory system in Verilog for static lookups and dynamic bitwise operations.  
   - Part 2: Extend the seating system with multiple modes (entrance, exit, search, list) and bonus FPGA implementation. fileciteturn8file3
